            <h3>Hi there! I am Chioma</h3>
            
            <p> <strong> Welcome to my page.</strong> <br><br>
                <strong>Background:</strong> I had my undergraduate degree in computer science, which were mostly theoretical than practical. After my
                graduation, there were no jobs in the IT field back in home country <em>(Nigeria)</em> as at then. I took up a role as a sales
                assistant to be able to pay my bills and cater for myself.
                I was able to attain the level of a sales manager with a branch to head. In all of this, I still did not feel passionate
                about my job. There was no job satisfaction and career growth after this level. I knew it was time to move onto what
                really inspires me and how I can make a difference in the world.
                I enrolled for a graduate program in Computer science with Cybersecurity concentration at the University of Nicosia,
                Cyprus. I was accepted and that was the beginning of my journey back into IT. This proved to be a problem at the onset,
                because everything seemed abstract as I had been out for a while, this made me buckle up and study a lot to meet up
                academically.
                <p><strong>INTERESTS IN TECH INDUSTRY:</strong> Having experienced people around me get scammed online and had unauthorized debits from
                their bank accounts with the bank having no knowledge on how to deal with these transactions ignited a passion for me to
                safeguard the cyber space and mitigate cyber- attacks. Hence, my interest in cyber security. However, there are various
                roles in this field, and I intend to become an ethical hacker or a penetration tester.
                To build a career as an Ethical hacker, there is a need for me to write scripts, and understand what source codes are
                supposed to do. Becoming a developer became an important factor to help me actualize this objective.
                </p> <br>
                <p><strong>PLANS:</strong> With the aid of online resources, I have been able to learn a lot and develop my skills in the tech industry. In
                conjunction with the courses, I have taken so far for my Graduate program. I have completed the Google IT Certificate
                via Coursera and have taken an Introduction to Cybersecurity via Cisco. I am quite confident I will be accepted into the
                Code Your Future program to enable me to acquire the developer skills as well.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>HOBBIES:</strong> At my leisure you will probably find me listening to music while relaxing. Or trying to compose beats in my
                head. I have always thought of making music as an alternative career if I were not delving into the tech space.
                You can also find me watching movies, to cool out when I am tensed up or stressed out. I find the distraction as a time
                to critically analyse situations and think about ways to solve problems. Most times, I get ideas from the movies.
                Taking long walks is another interesting aspect of my life. The admiration of natures beauty, the mere scent from leaves
                and the cool breeze that comes with it are all invigorating. Watching, analysing, and discussing sports is another
                mind-blowing interest of mine especially when it comes to football.
